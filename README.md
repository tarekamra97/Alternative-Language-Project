# Cell Phone Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project leverages java to perform detailed analysis and manipulation of a dataset containing mobile phone specifications. It includes a custom class for phone data encapsulation and methods for various analytics, like determining the average body weight of phones by manufacturer (OEM), identifying release timelines, and more.

## Programming Language and Version
- **Language:** java 8
- **Rationale:** Chosen for its robust library ecosystem, readability, and ease of use for data manipulation and analysis tasks.

## java Features and Usage
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The project utilizes OOP to structure data in classes, allowing for more organized and scalable code. A `Cell` class encapsulates phone data with methods for data cleaning and analysis.
- **File Ingestion:** Utilizes `pandas`, a powerful data manipulation library, to ingest data from CSV files efficiently.
- **Conditional Statements and Loops:** Employed throughout to handle data processing logic.
- **Assignment Statements:** Used for setting and modifying data stored in variables and object attributes.
- **Functions/Methods:** The project defines multiple class methods for performing operations like calculating statistics and filtering data based on specific criteria.
- **Unit Testing:** While not detailed in this summary, java supports unit testing through libraries such as `unittest` to ensure code reliability.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust exception handling mechanisms are implemented to manage potential runtime errors effectively.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas:** For reading CSV files and managing data in DataFrame structures, facilitating easy data manipulation.
- **Re (Regular Expressions):** Used for parsing and extracting specific patterns from string data, critical for data cleaning tasks.
- **Statistics:** Utilized for computing mathematical statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation necessary for analysis.

## Key Findings
- **OEM with Highest Average Body Weight:** HP with an average weight of 453.0 grams.
- **Phones Announced and Released in Different Years:** Several models were announced and released in different years, demonstrating market trends and release strategies.
- **Single Feature Sensors:** 432 phones in the dataset have only one feature sensor, indicating a segment of simpler devices.
- **Most Phones Launched Post-1999:** The year 2019 saw the highest number of phone launches, with 303 devices introduced.

## Conclusion
The java-based analysis of cell phone data provided insights into manufacturing trends, product features, and market dynamics. The project showcases java's capabilities in handling complex data sets and performing sophisticated data analysis to derive meaningful insights.
